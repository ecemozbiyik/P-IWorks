user interface specification document

1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements and behavior of the User Management Interface. This screen will allow administrators to manage users, including creating new users, editing existing ones, and enabling or disabling user accounts.

2. General Requirements
Responsive Design: The interface should be accessible on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Consistent UI: Use a uniform color palette and styling consistent with the application theme.
Role-Based Access: Only users with specific roles (e.g., Admin) should access this page.
Data Validation: All input fields should validate data (e.g., valid email formats).
Notification System: Provide feedback to users through notifications (e.g., "User saved successfully").
3. User Interface Components
3.1 User List Table
The User List is a table displaying information about all registered users.

Columns:
ID: A unique identifier for each user.
User Name: The username of the user.
Email: The user’s registered email.
Enabled: Displays whether the user is active (true/false).
Features:
Search & Filter: Users can search and filter results based on columns.
Sorting: Columns are sortable (ascending/descending).
Hide Disabled Users: A toggle option to hide users whose accounts are disabled.
3.2 New User Form
The New User Form allows admins to add or update user information.

Fields:
Username: Text input for the username (required).
Display Name: Full name of the user (optional).
Phone: Phone number input (optional).
Email: Email address input (required, must be unique and valid).
User Roles: A dropdown for selecting roles (Guest, Admin, SuperAdmin). Multiple selections are allowed.
Enabled: A checkbox to set whether the user is enabled or disabled.
Behavior:
Save Button: Once clicked, it validates the input and saves the user. If successful, a confirmation message is shown.
Validation: If validation fails, display error messages near the respective fields (e.g., “Invalid email format”).
4. Initial Page Load
Display the User List Table with all users loaded by default.
Disabled users are visible unless the "Hide Disabled User" option is toggled on.
The New User Form is empty on page load and used for adding a new user.
5. Behavior and Interactions
Adding a New User:

When a new user is added, it should appear immediately in the User List Table.
If a user with the same username or email already exists, display a relevant error message.
Updating a User:

Selecting a user from the table should populate the New User Form with their information for editing.
Changes are saved upon clicking the Save User button.
Enabling/Disabling Users:

When a user is disabled, their status changes in the Enabled column to false.
If the "Hide Disabled User" toggle is on, disabled users will be hidden from the list.


6. Error Handling and Validation
Duplicate Username/Email: Display an error message if a username or email is already taken.
Invalid Email Format: Ensure the email follows a valid format (e.g., user@example.com).
Empty Required Fields: Alert users if required fields (like Username and Email) are left empty.


8. Example User Roles and Permissions
Guest: Can view information but cannot modify.
Admin: Can add, edit, and disable users.
SuperAdmin: Has all admin permissions, including the ability to assign roles.

10. Technology Stack and Frameworks
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with Bootstrap for styling).
Backend: API for CRUD operations on user data.
Database: A relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store user information.

12. Future Enhancements
Pagination: For large datasets, introduce pagination in the User List Table.
Role Management: Allow dynamic creation of new roles.
Audit Logs: Track user actions (e.g., who added/edited a user).
